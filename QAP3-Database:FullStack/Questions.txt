How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 
(Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent 
working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can
 -an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

 It took 15 hours over the weekend and 5 hours throughout the week (this doesnt include break time)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What online resources you have used? 
 (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

I used the Database lectures more then anything, quite terrible with the database side so I also used some GPT to trouble check a few things
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. 
 (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

 No I didnt ask anyone for help
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? 
 If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

 No I didnt ask anyone for help 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, 
 and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem 
 requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this 
 one.

 1-10 1 being easy 10 being hard, I'd say a 7. 
 When I first started doing the project I had somewhat of an idea of how it look 
 but after really getting into the Database side which isnt really my strong suit 
 I was really screwed from initial thoughts but after some Linus class videos and 
 provided materials and W3Schools it got a bit easier still not my favourite thing 
 to work on but not difficult, I will say if I graduate and work in the field 
 I would much rather prefer front end with JavaScript and Css as thats my strong 
 suit not the Database side.
